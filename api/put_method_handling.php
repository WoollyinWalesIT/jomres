     * Parses PUT form variables and puts them into the $GLOBALS variable if required for use by api features
     *
     * PHP doesn't natively handle PUT requests, however standard REST API functionality is to use PUT method requests when performing updates. I haven't been as consistent with this as I should have been to date, however in the case of updating tariffs it's absolutely required to allow PUT requests to behave as forms therefore...
     * To get around that we will parse the "input" of PUT method requests and put them into $GLOBALS['PUT']. Api features can then access $GLOBALS['PUT'] to then get $_PUT for their own use, in just the same way as they would $_POST. Whilst technically using the "global" function is marginally, a teeny bit quicker, using $_PUT = $GLOBALS['PUT']; is much more consistent with how form fields are used in PHP, and it makes it obvious that we are working with super globals. This consistency will prove it's worth a few years down the road.
