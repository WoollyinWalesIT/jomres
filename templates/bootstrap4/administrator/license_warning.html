				Unfortunately you don't have a valid license number saved, so you will not be able to download plugins or get support.
			</p>
			<p>
				Plugins greatly extend the functionality of the system, and it's through sales of Download and Support licenses that we finance future development of Jomres.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would like to get access to any of the plugins listed in the Jomres plugin manager, or use our support service, we would ask that you <a href="https://license-server.jomres.net/order.php?cmd=products/licenses/list&product_id=13" target="_blank">consider purchasing a Download and Support license.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you do have a valid license key, please ensure that you have saved it in the <a href="{JOMRES_SITEPAGE_URL_ADMIN}&task=site_settings">Site Configuration -> Misc tab</a> <strong>Support key</strong> field.

						Even if you don't want or need the full features of the plugins and only use the free Core, you can still contribute to future Jomres development by buying us a coffee or pizza.
					</p>
					<p>
						It won't get you any support or plugins, but you'll definately feel better about yourself ;)
