Added code to paypal submission script that uses they guest's country to guess the language that paypal should be presented in.

Modified elements shown in gateways tab so that they'll always be edited/renamed in touch templates, not gateways tab in General Config.
Added optimiation of save blackbooking data. Thanks Netized.
Disabled editing mode for one element in contact owner that prevents form from submitting if editing mode left on.
Modified booking engine. Fixed creation of departure dropdown when "Bookings are for a fixed period" = No so that the "Booking period" option is used (previously was hard coded to 7).
Fixed issue where price was being calculated incorrectly when MRP used Micromanage and several diff room types were selected. 
Removed engine=innodb declarations from install_jomres.php


Jomres 3.4.4

Fixed bug in 3.4.3 where property details wasn't being pulled properly from property description and associated fields.

Jomres 3.4.3 

Modified edit & save property so that entered property description and associated fields are saved to custom_text as per the current language.
Modified jomresGetParam so that functions.php jomres_reconvertString function allows us to reconvert some sanitised data back to a appropriate html string.
Tweak to fix Joomla pathway when showing the pathway module.

Jomres 3.4.2

Modified blackbooking handling to allow selectall checkbox.
Tweaked functions.php to ensure various conversion features only use jrConfig calendar input format for javascript calendars.
Added lang definitions for "Your enquiry" to contact booking form and lang files, removed hard coding.

Jomres 3.4.1

Restored two elements (mrConfig['errorChecking'] & mrConfig['errorCheckingShowSQL']) to jomres_config.php because they were incorrectly removed in 3.4 but they are still being used by the redirect functionality. On upgrades this isn't noticable as these values had already been saved to the db, but on new installations it caused the redirect functionality to stop working, making Jomres more difficult to use.
Removed Jomres metadata handling. To the best of my knowledge it wasn't being used.
Minor tweak to integration handling so that new installations aren't producing errors because Jomres was attempting to insert settings to site_settings table before it had actually been created. Not a major issue in itself but could lead to some questioning of the functionality. 

Jomres 3.4

Added jquerycombo feature so that geographic searching can be performed via dropdowns that autopopulate. mod_jomsearch_m1 has been tweaked to be more appropriate to a banner/syndicate type module position.
Moved enabling of logging from jomres.php into Site Config.

Moved javascript calls into functions.php so that we can ensure that both jomres.php or j00030search.class.php are calling the same javascript files if needed.
Improved myuser's handling for listing bookings
Fixed issue in genericOr function which wasn't allowing all propertys configured to show after a search.
Added @ before any ini_set calls within Jomres. Some hosts are now disabling the ini_set feature of PHP, which is triggering fatal errors in PHP, the @ will supress this fatal error but Jomres might not then run as expected.
Small changes to db handling to ensure that results are unset after handing back.
Commented out some $mrConfig options in jomres_config.php that are no longer used.
Added contacthotel text to touch template handling in view property minicomp
Modified property header so that if the property's meta details are empty, then the property name is used to create the page title.
Removed blank option from room type dropdown in edit advanced tariffs page.
Modified touch template handling to output room type and room feature texts in touch templates. Removed same feature from property manager's Preview

Single person suppliment added to booking form. MRPs only.
Removed very old version notes from readme file and supplied link to the manual.
Modified how single person suppliments are applied when the sps is defined in an individual room, previously the sps was only applied once, now it's applied for every day of the booking.
Added optional switch email_when_done to componentArgs in guest and hotel email. Allows the email form to be called directly without actually sending it. Useful for previewing emails. See here for more info http://forum.jomres.net/index.php?topic=1087.msg4870#msg4870
Added new optional trigger 03500 to contact owner plugin which can be called when the contact email is sent so that admins wishing to use pay per lead can have a plugin (not available from Jomres.net but the framework is here if you want it http://forum.jomres.net/index.php?topic=1099.msg4864#msg4864)
Modified General Config so if the user is on Solo, then they're able to swap property types.

Added set memory limit to admin.jomres.php 
Changed jomresGetParams to use filter_var if the function is available

Switched on display of API key in front end property admin area
Room features tab in property admin switched off if SRP

Jomres 3.3rc1

Added ability for guests to cancel their own bookings.
Added an access check so that new users are prompted to log into the front end as admin. 
Added new temp folder in /components/com_jomres. Hard coded system log path to go to /components/com_jomres/temp as input filtering was messing around with paths on Windows based servers.

Added Joomla user name to booking details.
Added JOMRES_PHRASE_PROCESSING to gatewaypostage function

Removed erroneous delete of images from no longer existing images tables.
Completely rewrote the profiles handling functionality to make it simpler and more logical.
Modified settings handling for both mrConfig and jrConfig. All mrConfig settings should now by default be saved to the database under property_uid 0 on install/upgrade. Ditto for jrConfig and both jomres_config.php and site_config.php should only be referenced during install/upgrade.
Added new functionality to show all property details in one page (composite_property_details.html). As this is new functionality it is switched off by default, to enable it switch the site config option "Use Composite Property details" to Yes.
Added HDEPOSIT and DEPOSIT variables to hotel and guest emails. Not changed templates.
Fixed dodgy link for registration in J1.5.
Added new class custom_text. Fixed bug where constant DESCRIPTION was being input filtered to DEscr<x>iptION.
Fixed bug where the name of the default language file wasn't being found correctly in admin area.
Added some more tweaks to remove some options if we're an SRP because those options will just confuse an SRP property manager.
Bypassed a bug in IE where the editinplace input cannot be seen. Now IE users are stuck with using the popup input boxes, whereas firefox users will have it as editinplace.
Modified a couple of templates so that when Jomres tries to automatically close a popup IE no longer asks the user if this is ok. When Microsoft closes that loophole, we'll find another way around it.
Removed a stray echo from search functionality.
Fixed bug where property features aren't saved when a new property is created.
Set path in jomres.php for finding files to JRDS instead of /.

Clarified wording in plugin exception message.
Fixed issue in unzip library where module xml files weren't getting installed on windows boxes.
Added tweaks to save feature settings as euro symbol was getting mangled by the input filter.

Encryption option in General Config removed, encryption key replaced with jomresConfig_secret (aka mosconfig_secret). If you have previously stored any creditcard data in the database it will no longer be accessible unless your mosConfig_secret is the same as that used in the old encryption option field. For this reason, you are advised to manually copy/print out any saved creditcard details that you want to retain and re-enter them manually after upgrading.

Commented out Global Features and Global Room types options in backend site config. So many features in Jomres rely on these options being set to Yes that it's best to remove the option to set them to No.
Added option "Minimise configuration options" in site config. Allows the site manager to present a minimised set of options in the General Configuration. Means that there are less options for Property managers to play around with, and the Gen Config page renders faster in the browser.

Added code to output discount information to property list and view property pages

Curl fixes.
added image sorting.
Fixed issue where room features not showing in room details on booking form.
Added option to rooms config to enable translation of room features, and added same to booking engine to show changes.

Fixed issue with non-editor custom code only saving 1 and not the string.
updated slovak.php Many thanks to mojeslovensko for your hard work.
updated danish.php Many thanks to Ronny Buelund for your hard work.

Converted more hardcoded elements in backend to language defines
Moved patTemplate dump option to backend
Removed css tab completely as dump template vars option is now in backend, and diff templates feature is replaced with template override feature.

If you do not remove it you will simply find that it's settings no longer have any affect.
Forced $mrConfig['templatePack']="basic"; in jomres.php
Clicking Submit/Save in Edit Property page now takes you back to the edit property page so that you can continue editing.

Added bug reporting for super property managers to core of Jomres

Note, if you are using a custom/template override and upgrade to this version of Jomres you need to modify your dobooking.html & dobooking_srp.html files and add
var ajaxurl	= "{AJAXURL}";
under where livesite is defined. Failure to do this will result in your booking form stopping working.

Created new trigger point 05020, which in the base install includes dobooking.php (which initially constructs the booking form).
Created new trigger point 05010, which in the base install includes handlereq.php (which receives the ajax calls from the booking form).

Added connectivity testing to install_jomres.php. Allows us to test connectivity to the license server and identify any possible firewall issues right at the beginning.


Jomres v2.6 RC3.1
Resolved date in search form/booking form sometimes vastly in the future.
Resolved encryption key being saved but <?php not being saved to the encryption key file


Jomres v2.6 RC3
Modified booking form. Restored function that resets the selected rooms list as tariffs were not being reset properly when another date with a different tariff is selected

Jomres v2.6 RC3

Modified the mininterval functionality. Properties using flat rates will find the min interval set to the lowest min days found, average rate the opposite.
Tweaked the jomres hint menu output to resolve issues with ' (apostrophes, eg in french lang).
Added room_total, discount & currency code columns to contracts table, this info is now passed from the temp booking to the contracts table.

Fixed annoying message about mysql when changing a user's default property/access level.


Jomres v2.6 RC2
Number formatting. Added the option to choose your number formatting style, go into General Configuration -> Tariffs and Currencies to choose your number output style.
Booking form minimum-interval calculation. While searching for tariffs the booking process will remember all of the minimum days in the tariffs found and set the internal mininterval flag to the lowest figure found. This is expected to be useful for those properties that want to set the mininterval flag (IE the minimum number of days in a booking) to 1 for most of the time, but make it longer, eg over specific holiday periods by reacting to the tariffs found for a given period.
Modified the key generation code. For some reason, during keygeneration the http:// was being retained when the key is first generated for the hostname binding, but then it was being tested against the domain without the http://, consequentially installation was often failing. I've modified this by stripping out any occurances of http:// during the key gen process. 
Added code to stop already selected and still available rooms from being removed when a booking particular (eg date, guest numbers) has been changed.
Added xml logging. There are 3 types of logging: request (everything from $_REQUEST), system (various ad hoc values, as needed during dev/testing), gateway (logging for gateway calls), and booking (various booking log data is recorded). Logging files are currently written to the /media folder, this will probably be expended in the future. If you want to switch loggin on, edit jomres.php  and change $loggingEnabled to 'true';
Fixed a bug in insert booking function where jomressession wasn't always being passed to the script, therefore the booking wouldn't insert
Modifed functions.php getCurrentBookingData so that it would simply return, rather than exit, if jomressession is not set.
Fixed paging, starts on page 1 now.
Removed number_format from dobooking_functions, except from the overlib generation and extras output code.



Jomres v2.6 RC1
Fixed IPN not being confirmed correctly
Fixed unable to cancel booking
Added query to beginning of admin.jomres.net to check for the length of the license key, if it isn't set then task is set to showSiteConfig. 
Added Jomres control panel tabs object
Added departure date cookie
Major changes to allow operation in both Joomla 1.0.x & Joomla 1.5. Whilst Jomres now appears to work with Joomla 1.5Beta 1, none of the plugins do (need to create new 1.5 compatible installers)
Major changes to database query functionality to improve performance
Major changes to the basic template
Reworked dashboard calendar to improve performance
Reworked list propertys mini-component to improve performance
Reworked all of the front end templates so that their colours can be edited through a css file
Fixed users entering ' into booking form causing javascript error (Gratz Hamish)
Fixed installing sample data query bug
Fixed paging in search results
Fixed US room tax functionality
Modified search functionality: If the availability search is used in combination with the room type search then properties without an available room of requested room type are excluded from the results.
The non-basic templates aren't getting updated and the template overrides are a better method of creating your own template. They have been removed, if you want your own look for the Jomres then it is highly advised that you install the basic template override pack and edit that.
Removed the css config option introduced in v2.0. 
Room list generation output split into two to allow rooms list to be presented side by side if required (Gratz Hazel)


Jomres v2.5.0.1

Changed jr_gettext function to return data html_entity_decode'd so that html can be used in various input fields
Changed Extras ajax call from getResponse to getResponse_guest to prevent the rooms field from being hidden after an extra is selected.
Changed how special requirements are handled.
Changed booking out page. As Jomres' main focus is on the taking of bookings, rather than the hotel admin side of things, I felt it was wise to not spend too much time on something that's rarely used, so reduced the amount of information stored there.
Changed dashboard cookie expiry to 1 hour
Changed added guest numbers check to average rate method
Changed allowed super property managers to make bookings on properties different to their currently active property (switches active property then redirects them)
Ensured that booking engine uses the jr_gettext function, rather than the built in function.
Removed show_log that was appearing twice in jomres.js, causing the log output to be triggered twice in the booking form when some elements were selected
Removed a couple of information elements from certain pages as they are now covered by the Context Sensitive Help mini-component.
Fixed listproperties, wasn't finding the property image
Fixed savehotelsettings wasn't updating new settings 

Jomres 2.5

// Stable
Various bug fixes
Changed how general config is displayed and updated to speed up update time. General config still slow in IE due to IE not rendering the javascript colour pickers quickly enough.
Function to get property specific settings modified to import mrConfig 
from jomres_config.php. This is because imported properties will not 
have a complete set of settings imported. It also allows us to only 
insert settings that are pertinent to this property in the settings table, 
allowing us to set a given setting as the default in jomres_config.php.
Only applies to properties created after install of this version of Jomres.
Improved averaging model method in booking form.
Modified jomres.php so that in the event that no property data exists it will 
search for a trigger 06000 so that an import function can be used.
Added option to override "task" with "task2" if required in jomres.php. Not currently used, 
but gives us possible future extendability.



Added jomres_toolbar class - very pretty
Added phpDocumenter tags
Added lowest tariff price to listproperties
Added more property details to listproperties
Added mini-component collision detection
Added module 0 to module pack - Allows for searching within the component area
Added wildcard searching on dropdowns
Added new image uploading class - Image Fullsize image width is set in backend, as are the slideshow choice and popup sizes, gives webmaster more chance of attaining a consistent look to their site. 
Added if errorchecking on then output to text file in /media/ with logs
Added CURL to license communication routines. This is for users who don't have access to fopen to use Jomres.
Changed moved averaging and flatrate calculation methods into dobooking_functions and added config option so that property managers can choose their tariff model
Changed tariff handling so that template overrides can be provided in one file instead of seperate files. Important, see readme.
Changed Put averaging & flat rate methods into jomres_booking object, added configuration option to Tariffs config panel to choose one of these models
Changed refactored the search functionality so that it's one of the mini-components. The search modules as a result have had to be rewritten, if you use the search modules then you'll need to download and install the new m1 -> m4 modules. To get searching in the content panel install the m0 module (READ THE NOTES!) 
Changed room & tariff editing functionality to mini-components
Changed booking confirmation, insert and completion to mini-components
Change paypal insert of booking. The insert of the booking is now performed at the IPN stage, as the payment is confirmed here anyway. It saves users who navigate away from the paypal payment screen without returning to the jomres site from loosing their bookings. Now returning to the jomres site simply takes them to the booking confirmation page.
Change managers can now search while logged in. If they are a super property manager then when they click to view a property then their active property will be changed to that property
Redesigned the listpropertys template a little

Jomres v1.3

Important! If you have installed previous versions of Jomres you much check the readme.txt for updates to your tables to bring them into line with this version. This applies even if you have uninstalled a previous version of Jomres, because the uninstallation of Mosres/Jomres is non-database destructive. If you have previously installed Jomres be aware that v1.2 onwards uses different table names (xxx_jomres_xxxxxx as opposed to xxx_mosres_xxxxxx) so if you want to retain your data then you will need to rename your tables. There is a file in the docs subdir called "upgrade tables 1.1 - 1.3.txt" which should help you with this, but use it at your own risk.

If you are using the Super Manager mode the first thing you need to do is click Change Properties (which you will see if you have more than one property on the system) to properly set your user up.

Changelog for v1.3:

Added: Property switching. Previously Super Property Managers would view all the elements for all the properties. This could cause confusion, and sometimes Jomres just wouldn't work right because it didn't know which property it was working against. The first time you visit your property as property manager after upgrading to v1.3, if you have more than one property listed then click Change Property to initialise your user properly.
Added: Our tariffs link. There's a new template show_tariffs.tmpl to work with this functionality.
Added: Editing mode. See the tutorials on jomres.net for a demonstration.
Added: Property types. Configured at the back end of the system. Not configurable by Property Managers
Added: Ability to search the current country/region/property type when there are more than one property in said region/property type.
Added: Book guest out option to Display booking tabbed page (providing that they are currently booked in)
Added: "Remainder to pay" label to the display booking page. Shows the grand total minus the deposit paid, if the deposit has been paid (duh).
Added: search.tmpl. This template contains the dropdown boxes that allow a visitor to choose from a number of different properties. If there's only one property on the system, then naturally this option isn't shown.
Added: bottom.tmpl. This doesn't actually have any info presented to it from a script, it's just there in case you want a footer.
Added: Item ids.
Added: Sef.



Fixed: Guests are now unique to a property. Property managers/receptionists can only admin their own guests
Fixed: Where varying types of tariffs weren't being offered for each room. Only one tariff for each room was being offered. Bug introduced by templating func, so versions prior to 1.2 not affected. A fixed version of 1.2 is available at http://upgrades.jomres.net for license holders.
Fixed: Paypal playing up again. Thanks Graham.
Change: If "Limit advance bookings" is on, then the availability calendars no longer offer dates later than the end of the chosen period. This is not yet true for the javascript calendars.
Change: Added option to settings to change the number of months of the availability calendar is shown.
Change: Added option to Tariffs & Currencies. Amount charged at booking time. You can now select to charge the full amount or a smaller deposit

Change: Modified how the user is authorised to cut down on database access.
Change: Added templating functionality to booking cancellation
Change: Added code to remember active tabs.
