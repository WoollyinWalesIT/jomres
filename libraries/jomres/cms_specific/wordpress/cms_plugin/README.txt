[Installation videos](https://www.jomres.net/download)

Jomres Core is free but its real power comes from its plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Jomres free? =

Yes. Jomres follows the [Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_core) business model for Open Source projects. The Jomres Core itself is free to download and install. To help pay the bills some features of the system are delivered as plugins in the Jomres Plugin Manager, to download those you will need a license key saved in your Jomres installation's Site Configuration page.

= What do I get for free? =

	**Tried and tested** Jomres is a true bookings portal and has thousands of users who've helped us to fine-tune the system to make it the best in it's class.
	**Large and enthusiastic community forum** Before choosing a competitor, check out their forums, if they have one. In our experience a plugin's real value can be determined from a forum's activity, it is the heart and soul of the project. If the forum's dead, so is the project. Don't believe fake reviews, look for yourself.
	**Totally multilingual** 45 language files are included by default. Unique label editing feature allows each property to have their own labels, and our Language Context feature allows different property types to have completely different language files.
	**Supports both Bootstrap 2 and Bootstrap 3, another first** Completely responsive. We have adhered to the BS2 and BS3 coding standards religiously, so Jomres will work in any theme that uses Bootstrap. As always, where we lead other Booking systems will follow.
	**Works for just single property sites, or multiple properties** Equally suited to booking hotels, B&Bs and individual properties like apartments and villas, cars, boats and tools.
	**Intelligent, Ajax driven reservation system** Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for guests to make bookings. Two different room list styles, autodetect guest country, even disable the depature date input altogether. Each property can have different Required fields in the form. Property managers can enable/disable booking functionality on each property at the flick of a switch. For hotels, single person supplements can be applied in the event of under-occupancy. Each property chooses it's own currency and pricing output format. Create new Wordpress users when unregistered users book for the first time. Room locking means that if one person selects a room during booking, another person using the form at the same time can't book the same room.
	**Optimised for performance** our clients have successfully used it on websites with more than 30,000 properties listed. Guests, invoices and booking listings are all Ajax driven meaning that it deals with large data volumes very easily.
	**Bookings per night or per day** Deposits can be a percentage or flat rate, or the first day's booking cost. Variable depsosits based on the number days from today determine if the deposit paid should be a smaller fee, or the whole booking cost.
	**We listen to our users** The property manager's User Interface has been designed after consulting with real property managers to provide the most logical User eXperience possible.
	**Clear separation of Site and Property manager responsibilities** All property management is done via the front end of the site, no need to allow managers to access the administrator area.
	**Todo lists** They guide your property managers through setting up individual properties, from pricing through to property description and images.
	**Simple or extended property configuration** Site managers choose whether property managers should have few, or many settings to choose from.
	**Crisp, clean dashboard** Drag and click the calendar to create or modify a booking's room and dates, or drag away to easily cancel a booking.
	**Slick Media Centre** Images are exceptionally easy to upload, and you can upload images for the main asset image, property list slideshow, main property page slideshow and more. Small, medium and large images are created automatically and the slideshow for displaying images is fully responsive.
	**Calendars** Several different calendars for displaying occupancies and arrivals and departures. Whether it's a villa or hotel, you'll know at a glance how busy you are.
	**Amend bookings** After a booking has been created, add extras to bookings while the guest is on-site, or completely change the booking's dates and prices.
	**Email templates** Property managers can customise the email templates to suit their individual properties.
	**Detailed invoicing** Shows all line items, including tax. Additional items added to invoices can have their own tax rates.
	**Taxes** Accommodation and other services can each use their own tax codes.
	**Guests have their own accounts** Their details are remembered from visit to visit.
	**Guest dashboard** This allows them to easily see their bookings, invoices and favourite properties.
	**Contact form** If the guest's not ready to book right away, they can contact the hotel directly through a simple form instead.
	**Elegant Property List** Shows multiple views including List and Photo views, plus various sorting features and when a guest sets a budget then properties outside that budget are de-emphasised. Offers both infinite scrolling or paging to show search results.
	**Property comparison** page Guests can compare up to 3 properties at a time.
	**Property feature icons** Create by property managers, they can be defined for all property types, or just one property type.
	**Review functionality** Reviews can either be automatically approved or not, guests can input comments and other reviewers can score a review's helpfulness.
	**Fully automatic exchange rate conversion** No configuration required at all, just request a free API key from OpenExchangeRates and Jomres will download the current rates daily and use them as needed.
	**Plugins plugins plugins** Using our plugin philosophy, all areas of Jomres functionality can be modified. This has helped to breed a healthy and diverse plugin community.
	**Modular** It's designed to be third party plug-in friendly. See the extension specific plugins page here on the JED, or visit our Partners page.
	**Google maps well supported** Drag and drop pointers or type your address for the pointer to move. Choose to show POI's or not, and choose a map colour scheme that suits your site's theme. 30+ map styles so that the maps match your site's theme.
	**QR codes in both front and back end facing pages** Receptionists can scan a customer's booking printout and immediately book them in on arrival. Guests can scan QR codes to be taken to directions to the property.
	**Logging** Detailed logging for the data-nerds out there. Extensive log files that are cycled regularly, and logging can be sent to a remote syslog server.
	**Recaptcha** Uses the most modern No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA in contact forms to reduce spam.

= If I purchase a license key what happens when the license expires? =

Nothing at all. You continue using the software, although you will not be able to download updates to the plugins.

= Is there a manual? =

Yup, the [manual](https://www.jomres.net/manual/) is available to all users. It's very well documented, and there are video tutorials if you prefer to learn that way.

= Is there a demo? =

[Yes, see here](http://wordpress-hotel.jomres.net/) This demo is built in Wordpress and uses our extremely popular Leohtian template. You can download a copy of this site as we offer all of our demos as Quickstart packages, which make it very simple and quick to deploy a new Jomres and Wordpress installation for your clients.

= Where can I get support? =

If you've got a download and support license you can raise a [ticket](http://tickets.jomres.net), and you can also join the [Community Forum](https://www.jomres.net/forum) and ask your questions there.

= Jomres 9.9.13 29/09/2017 =

* Fixed an issue when creating new Joomla users in J! 3.8  Thanks Rod.
* Solved a bug on fresh installs which prevented the proper creation of guest profiles table
* Solved a problem with default value of language_context on fresh installs
* Solved a problem in jomres settings table which prevented an index being created because the akey column length was higher than 1000 bytes, so changed the akey column length to varchar(100). Should be more than enough for any setting name.

= Jomres 9.9.12 27/09/2017 =

* Flight library moved to top level vendor directory
* manager_properties_none.html updated to produce output to advise user to use a different property manager for webhooks.
* Plugin images re-added to plugin list as they're now (mostly) on an ssl enabled server.
* Added an option to property types to set if this property type allows stars classification or not. Depending on this, the stars input will be shown/not shown in edit property page.
* Added BOOKING_LENGTH output to emails (number of days/nights)

* Modified api, a change to dependencies broke the api's ability to find the http_build_url function that was recently moved.
* When amending a booking from dashboard, check availability even if this is just a room switch. It may happen that the currently checked in guest with a departure overdue may not be in the current view. Thanks Jad Makhlouta for pointing this out.
* Return empty array if no custom fields are available for this property type id
* Removed output_filters function override because we use that function even before the 00001 trigger point


= Jomres 9.9.11 20/09/2017 =

* Changed where we trigger 00001
* Improved how we pass the selected number of guests from search modules to the first guest type dropdown on the booking form
* Added http_build_url class to dependencies
* Jomres cron jobs will also be triggered when needed on non jomres specific pages that have jomres plugins as modules/widgets.
* Improved how we get the property details url on Joomla when we have a specific Joomla menu item for a property.
* Price output function modified to use and display only 2 decimals
* Sort images by filename when getting their details from db
* Only show video tutorials in frontend if using bootstrap templates
* Modified how guest cancellations are performed so that they're using a standard class, and ensure that the webhook is triggered.

* Resolved an issue in Joomla 3.8 caused by changes to Joomla's version file that would prevent Jomres from working.
* Solved a problem with property details sef urls in emails (joomla only)
* Solved a problem with properties being displayed twice in list properties tables

* Fixed an issue with description search returning wrong results due a missing property_ors in the 2nd query.
* Solved a problem with existing room descriptions not being updated for the currently active language.


= Jomres 9.9.10 31/08/2017 =

* Changed how we upload user profile images to make it consistent with media centre uploads, so we can use db image details, s3 and cloudfront integrations. Existing user images need to be reuploaded. Added support for adding hidden media centre resources that can be used internally and don`t show up in media centre dropdowns. First use for this is user images.
* Modified feedback message handling so that it also uses redirect messages.
* Changed position of the user feedback div in admin area
* Broke user initialisation into own method as we need a way to re-initialise a user programatically sometimes.
* Modified 99994 trigger so that all  99994 triggers are called after redirection not just one specific webhook trigger.
* Improved the jomres_properties class to ensure that created properties custom text always uses the newly created property uid.
* Fixed a bug in new category searching functionality

*  Solved a problem related to duplicate coupon discount on invoices
*  Solved a problem related to widget selector showing up on search results pages
*  Fixed a typo that was preventing some deferred tasks from running
*  Added missing property categories output in bootstrap 2 and jquery ui templates
*  Solved a problem in the installer related to language context default value

= Jomres 9.9.9 21/08/2017 = 

* Added support for property categories. This is a simple feature that allows managers to create property categories, which can then be added as both menu options to Joomla, or added as shortcodes to articles/pages in both Joomla and Wordpress.
* Added changes to allow us to have global coupon codes (created by site admins) that apply to all properties.
* Added a minimum deposit value setting to property configuration. If the deposit calculated is less than N figure, then the N figure is used to define the deposit.
* Added the language context feature to language file translation page in jomres admin cpanel. This way we can have property type specific language strings, without needing to have property type specific language files (which are mostly duplicate language strings, very few really different). Everything is stored in db, so it`s upgrade safe.
* Added support to save media centre image details in db to avoid scanning dirs each time a page loads to find all images.
* Added Amazon S3 and CloudFront integration for images.
 
* Invoice webhooks updated
* Added support to view only invoice line items and transactions, will be used later.
* Added a constant for jomres core-minicomponents dir
* Don`t show delete property menu item if this manager has access only to one property
* Added deposit ref to deposit line item on invoices
* Added a new administrator area video showing property creation, to help new users understand that they need to log into the frontend.
* Added support for composer and autoloading external libraries
* Removed adodb and used php date and mktime functions. Added monolog to dependencies
* Added a define for the updates path
* Added a jomres class that checks availability for dates and room uids
* Added a new generic black booking insert class
* Added a new ical import library
* Removed some unneeded cache files
* Tweaked sockets timeouts because we don`t need to wait too long for a response
* Removed a specific check for classes in custom_code dir, as that dir is already available in the classes registry
* Added cpanel task to excluded tasks in access control, as this is the cpanel default frontpage
* Removed property type specific language files. Now we can have property type specific language strings saved in db, so no need to duplicate an entire file for each property type.
* Added property categories tutorial video
* Added Armenian language file to system. Thanks Hamlet.
* Removed the unused bootstrap-tour js files
* Disabled image rotation based on exif meta data
* Added feature to allow devs to rerun the plugin installer script without needing to reinstall a plugin. Useful when creating plugins and you want to recreate database tables.
* Removed some unused options (component wrapped) and cleaned up code
* Added video tutorials to BS2 top.html.
* Updated css so that the video tutorials button would stand out more as even some of our more regular users had failed to see that it exists.
* Added an ioncube version test to plugin manager installer.

* Fixed an issue where the guest's cancel booking button text would not appear.
* Solved a problem that`s sometimes encountered with jintour properties and coupons
* Solved some bugs that prevented subscriptions being updated properly
* Fixed how coupons are displayed in price summary, tax was added on top of the discount.
* Solved a js error when we drag an event to cancel it and cancellation can`t be made
* Fixed an issue that prevented us from moving bookings to another property. Seems there was a bug in place in some code since before 2009 (!). Thanks Jad


= Jomres 9.9.8 31/07/2017 =

* Property Completion highlighting. Properties that have been completed ( IE prices updated, images uploaded etc ) are now highlighted to site administrations that they're now ready for approval ( if the feature is enabled ). Similar highlighting added to frontend property lists so that property managers can see those properties that are still awaiting completion.
* Context sensitive video tutorials added to system, both administrator area and frontend. Videos are done without voice-overs or text so that they are largely language agnostic, language file can be copied and edited by site admins if required for other languages.

* Repurposed an old setting to use it to disable avl calendars in property details
* Made property list default to paging instead of live scrolling
* Undone a previous change which makes label translations save the xx language shortcode instead of xx-XX language code, causing translated text not to be pulled from db when selecting by xx-XX language code.
* Sanity check messages will be displayed on all pages, without excepted tasks
* Removed some unimportant warnings from administrator area.
* Cleanup up some unneeded notices, clarified the license status messages and added action buttons
* If IPInfoDB api key is not set, we`ll not default to EUR anymore, instead we`ll default to the currency set in site configuration.
* Removed the simple/advanced config toggle, not very popular as folks seem to miss the advanced settings in property configuration. 
* Combined all map related settings in site config to one google map tab only.
* Made the fullscreen view available on small screens too and removed an unused setting
* Added shortlist/favourites shortcode.
* Made the FAQ a menu item in the jomres control panel help section and removed the button.

* Fixed a bug in how we prepare the rates and mindays arrays before creating the tariffs

= Jomres 9.9.7 20/07/2017 =

* Webhooks Core and API Core moved into main application. There are a lot of ways that we can use this functionality, however having these particular two features as plugins is more of a hinderance than a help, therefore they've been moved into the core.

* Modified the shortcode parser so that if a class exists, don't include the file. This doesn't address any bugs in Jomres, instead it addresses the possibility of triggering an error if a developer or designer should create a fatal error by copying a minicomponent, e.g. to create a backup of a file.
* Updated shortcodes instructions to make sure that feature uids information is correct.
* Updated how Jomres Pricing information is retrieved.
* Added a check for filesize being zero when installing the plugin manager.
* Tweaked menus to not show some options if upcoming property limitations are applied.

= Jomres 9.9.6 12/07/2017 =

* Our implementation of OAuth2 scripts updated to extend the lifetime of the tokens, and allow implicit token issuing.
* Changed property type class so that property types are retrieved in alphabetical order.
* Modified patErrorManager to record an error in the event of problems because it will provide us with backtracing information.
* Modified jomres_properties class so that new properties default room will get a basic room type, meaning that Micromanage editing mode can be used right off the bat.
* Tweaked an error message to clarify it's source.
* Added payment method as booking note.
* Monolog and OAuth2 libs updated.
* Tweaked rest api authorize controller so that if it returns an error about return urls, it tells you which url it's expecting, versus what was sent.
* Added support for auth free access to the REST API functionality. This feature allows us to offer additional REST API functionality that doesn't demand client id & secret keypairs, so that there are fewer barriers between your clients and your API.
* Made the search misc menu item visible to receptionists or above. No need for this menu to be visible to guests.
* Cancellation threashold now available for tour property bookings too.
* Removed Read More javascript functionality as it's not an elegant solution.
* Added Jomres price plans to main menu
* Renamed Upgrades to Updates. Upgrades has always been the wrong word to use in this context.
* Added license name to output content of Site Config license data.
* Exchange rates : Added a check for $json to see if it's false ( connection errors can cause this ).
* Updated a task in approval urls with the next task name
* Added a unique css class to each property that can be used to customize css for each property uid individually
* Updated show property map shortcode data to include map_zoom

* Fixed a notice in Show Plugins referring to third party plugins.
* Fixed notices that may appear in booking form and confirmation if an older tax rate has been deleted when building extras info.
* Fixed some bugs in new Norwegian language file.
* Solved a problem related to receptionists not being able to see the booking details

* Solved a problem on booking page related to empty strings being handled as arrays
* Fixed an issue where log files might not appear in log list.
* Solved a property comparison problem which caused all checkboxes on the page to be checked if checked
* Solved a problem related to how coupon discounts are added to invoices
* Solved a geocoding related problem where country was always reset to DE

* Added ability for editinplace admin script to pass language to the updateCustomText function as get_showtime("lang") was reporting the wrong language.


= Jomres 9.9.5 19/06/2017 =

* Huge update to Norwegian language file. Thanks Edvin.
* Modified an error trigger so that double booking exceptions can only be triggered by the processpayment task.
* Added shortcode information about the new property task. ( Jomres ASAModule mambot has also been updated to support this ).

* Re-added the (previously obsoleted) jomres_formatBytes function as some older automatically generated language files need it. Without it they'll throw a fatal error when users upgrade from 9.9.3 to 9.9.4

= Jomres 9.9.4 13/06/2017 =

* Improved viewproperty so that if Show Only Availability calendar setting is used, then we properly use settings from Property Details configuration options.
* Improved edit property type script so that fallback markers are properly found and displayed.
* Installer modified because one of our client's firewalls 403'd when it saw >> in the POST data.
* Moved the town and marker uploaders to the core to simplify things
* Re-enabled the property type dropdown on the edit property page, folks seem to need it.
* Whenever the property type is changed, we`ll delete all rooms, tariffs and property settings. This also resets availability.
* Modified region related functionality so that if a property has an incorrect region id then the property is not returned in the search results, and it is unpublished. This is better than throwing a fatal error, and being unpublished highlights to the manager that it's not currently available. 
* Added a new trigger to allow plugins to add their own warnings to the Jomres Control Panel.
* Changed log cleanup frequency to hourly.
* Added functionality to allow 3rd party developers to offer links to documents that provide current version information. ( Plugin manager )
* Removed some very old unused functions
* Romanian VAT updated
* Improved agent details layout
* Timeline menu hidden for real estate properties
* We'll silently switch from mysql to mysqli if function doesn't exist instead of faithfully following Joomla's configuration.php file. It looks like that's what J is doing as of 3.7.x and it makes sense.
* Removed plugin images from plugin manager as they can point to http sites, resulting in mixed content warnings.

* Tweaked the initial set timeout function to be a little more friendly for shared hosting packages.
* Notice fixes
* Removed some redundant code which caused an error when paying for approved bookings
* Removed a slash which was breaking property feature tooltip images in basic search modules.
* Solved a booking form error by removing some redundant code.
* Guest types class updated to allow float values in the Variance field ( used to, new class was incorrect ).

= Jomres 9.9.3 01/06/2017 =

* We disabled the dropdown to choose property types in the previous version. In the past, regardless of whether or not the dropdown was disabled, the value of the dropdown would still be sent by the browser. It would appear that current versions of browsers no longer send the content of that dropdown, which triggers an error when saving any property.
* Fixed notices in weekly occupancy percentages script.
* Fixed an issue when manually creating new guests.

= Jomres 9.9.2 01/06/2017 =

* Solved a redirect problem when installing jomres
* Fixed an issue with property list paging.
* Fixed an issue where dashboard settings wouldn't be saved when a guest profile hasn't been created for a manager yet.
* Warn about the ipinfodb and openexchangerates api keys only if "use currency conversion" is enabled in site config.
* Removed a query that`s not needed.

= Jomres 9.9.1 30/05/2017 =

*  Added jomres frontend control panel widgets. The Jomres Dashboard ( now renamed to frontend Control Panel ) is now dynamic, meaning you can add/remove widgets to the Property Manager's control panel as well as use Drag and Drop to move them around.
*  Disabled option to change property type after a property has been created. 

*  Changed datatables scripts so they won`t interfere with mod security rules
*  tweaked the reinstall all plugins message when no license key set
*  Improved how and when we get all regions from db
*  Added region to property details sanity check and removed postcode and tel as they`re not used by everybody or on all properties
*  Replaced hardcoded /jomres/uploadedimages path with it`s defined constant
*  Replaced hardcoded /jomres/temp path with it`s defined constant
*  Removed usage reporting and tweaked the api keys warning colours in admin cpanel
*  Removed unused site config settings
*  Made the cms user register/login separate tasks that redirect to the cms registration/login form. This allows us to control the menu register/login jomres menu items access levels too
*  Added guest_uid index to contracts table
*  Improved jomres sessions handling
*  Tweaked edit guests page so that the blacklist option and text will show up only when editing existing guests.
*  Updated jquery ui
*  Slightly increased the delay value when searching in datatables
*  Updated chart js
*  Slovenian regions added to countries.php so that new installations will have regions installed.
*  Made the bookings chart the default chart selected on reports
*  Added chart fixed height support to be used later
*  Changed regions class so that when region id is 0 or blank, we`ll return an empty string instead of throwing an error.
*  Made sure that properties can be published/unpublished on user suspension only if the user has a manager/receptionist user role.
*  Modified frontend functionality so that dashboard ( to be renamed timeline ) is part of a subset of cpanel templates.
*  Menu option added to put weekly percentage view into reports menu option.
*  Creating the object using j05000 script to allow dobooking method override.
*  Added request_log call to jomres.php to be triggered if in development mode.
*  Changed a language definition for book now because SEF urls with different strings for the book now text wont work on different property types.
*  Tweak to make sure we also reset the logged in manager to non manager when it doesn`t have any properties assigned
*  Added some code that will remove orphan rooms for properties that have had their property types changed, and an extra sanity check. These will remain commented out as in 9.9.1 we are removing the ability to change property types, however the change will remain in case we reverse this decision.

*  Fixed a bug in access control and added the 00035 property details tabs/blocks to access control. This allows us to set property details blocks/tabs specific access levels.
*  Temp fix for php 7.1 session ids which have max 256 chars. Jomres sessions only allow 50 chars, so we`ll substr the first 50 chars of session id
*  Resolved an issue where wire transfer couldn't trigger 00605 to send emails.
*  Fixed a bug in DT ajax options
*  Made public a function that is called in j06002edit_tariffs_normal.class.php
*  Fixed a notice on jomres install related to jr user not being ready.
*  Fixed notices for when markers are not created for a property type.
*  Tweaked view agent to only show agent name in browser title if task is set to view_agent.
*  Fixed a bug in the normal tariff editing mode that tries to address an edge case created by switching property types.
*  Solved access control problem for viewproperty and dobooking menus and tasks.

*  Changed some variable names in datatables ajax request so they won`t conflict with WP public query vars

= Jomres 9.9.0 16/05/2017 =

*  Added new tariffs handling class. This brings several benefits for future development, with respect to the new booking engine and API development.
*  Refactored both front and backend menu systems. Plugin settings moved to Site Configuration and entire administrator area rebuilt to be more logical.
*  Session handling completely refactored to store data in the database, not files. Performance improvement.
*  Region name handling refactored. Performance improvement. 
*  Added country flags as css to lower the number of requests on pages that display the country flags (eg: top destinations)

* Change :  Added a tweak to logging to ensure that browser console notification messages aren't attempted if the call is an API call.
* Change :  Removed a duplicate definition

= Jomres 9.8.21 Version skipped = 

= Jomres 9.8.20 01/12/2016 = 

* Change :  Writability check panel removed as it`s not useful anymore

* Fix :  Fixed a bug where registered users can't create a new property because their access level was set to the wrong value.

= Jomres 9.8.19 28/11/2016 = 

* Feature :  Added Markdown handling functionality to Jomres. 
This allows non-super property managers to format text in a simple way without being able to add html to the page. Allowing property managers to enter html in property decriptions is fraught with danger ( Cross site scripting being the main worry), which is why we've always defaulted to the most stringent settings on a default installation. This isn't very friendly for new users, however, or property managers that want to apply some formatting but the site has left the Input Filtering setting to Paranoid. Markdown handling allows non-super managers to add basic formatting to text inputs ( for example Property Details, Checkin times ) without sacrificing security. Two new libraries have been added, one to display a Markdown editor in the Edit Property page ( relevant inputs ) called SimpleMDE and a second ( Parsedown )to parse text before it's output to the page. 
* Feature :  Improved the Media Centre.
Made media centre drop down buttons larger and gave the primary and secondary dropdowns their own classes to make them stand out more.
Rooms list added "room" text next to number.
Removed old image link from the images list, instead resource types are able to offer a "Preview" link, which, if available will show an example of the resource in property page inside a modal.
Added additional instructions to give clarity for the usage of the buttons.
* Feature :  Added functionality to allow us to show the main menu in selected locations. 
This allows us to show the Jomres main menu in other places ( See Shortcodes info page ). It doesn't disable the menu from displaying in the Jomres content area, however.

* Change :  Jomres Core files updated to use PSR2 coding standards.
* Change :  Show plugins, Upgrade button renamed to Update.
* Change :  Modified input filtering to preserve line breaks in text that's saved to the database. Related to Markdown.
* Change :  API updated to log an error instead of output it.
* Change :  Added cms specific function to get username by id.
* Change :  Modified the license message position in plugin manager.
* Change :  Minor language file tweak for th-TH.
* Change :  Added new property features classes.
* Change :  Completely rebuilt Jomres user roles. Receptionist access level changed from 1 -> 50, manager 2->70, super property manager was having access level 2 and pu set to 1, now it`s 90. Provides scope for future improvements.

* Fix :  Fixed a typo that prevented us from adding new users in Joomla when making a booking.
* Fix :  Resolved an issue with users being unable to add new property types.
* Fix :  Modified call to Mobile_Detect class, to check that the class doesn't already exist ( other extensions use the same class, so this could cause conflicts ).
* Fix :  Modified contact owner so that the template has it's own version of placeholders that don't have javascript that will cause confusion if the editing mode is enabled.
* Fix :  Fixed a query that was failing in some cases, thanks Rod ( Invoices class ).
* Fix :  Solved resource/room cloning problem.

* Change :  Modified the registry class to remove javascript caches whenever the registry is rebuilt.
* Change :  Added performance improvements to list reviews script in admin area.

* Change :  Tourist tax plugin code added to the core of the system.
* Change :  Added tweaks to WP url handling to avoid some wp redirectsion from non-sef to sef urls

= Jomres 9.8.17 04/11/2016 =

* Feature :  Added a longtext class and appropriate javascript so that tab contents can be limited to N characters.
* Feature :  Updated the ajax notification loader. Previously it was configured to change the cursor on ajax activity, however mobile devices don't have cursors, so swapped it out for a nice font awesome spinner instead. Now users can see the the ajax search is doing something. Likewise, property managers can see the activity notification.


* Change :  Added full Jomres version to relevant files.
* Change :  Reverted a recent change to an API script vis directory scanning as API doesn't always have access to Jomres framework so the custom scandir function will not be available.

* Wordpress :  Updated a CMS specific script to correctly pull wordpress module settings.

* Change :  Removed exchange rates cron script as it's no longer required.

* Change :  Tweaked a query in list invoices ajax script to resolve some mysql notices.
* Change :  Added a tweak to decode apostrophes to their proper form in email subjects.
* Change :  Tweaked tabletools handling so that when clicking on xls link the page name is used when naming the file.
* Change :  Booking confirmation page updated, amend booking element changed from a submit button to a link. It doesn't need to be a submit form, and it's recently stopped redirecting back to the booking form.
* Change :  Tweaked a search query that sorts properties in descending order. Removed that ordering.

= Jomres 9.8.15 18/10/2016 = 

* Feature :  Added filesystem integrity check feature.

* Change :  Improved caching of geolocation caching, seems our performance problems were caused by throttling by the remote service.
* Change :  Added a new input filter results cache for testing. 
* Change :  Added further speed improvements to registry. Also made the registry readable. We just include_once, no more unserialize on each page load.
* Change :  Added small change to get property names multi so that even without caching the query won`t be executed more times on the same page for the same property uids
* Change :  Modified how property names are found. Performance improvement.
* Change :  Modified functionality so that on redirect we explicitly close database connections. All the documentation says we shouldn't need to, but this is a test to see if we can reduce the number of connections left open.
* Change :  Replaced scandir with more efficient home-rolled function.
* Change :  Improved an estimate generation method in the booking engine, major speed improvement for properties with many tariffs.
Changed how we checked to see if an array is empty, instead of counting. Minor performance boost.

* Change :  Added phone number to Contact Owner form.
* Change :  Added alert-danger for BS3 users in edit booking script.
* Change :  Updated add service to bill function so that if the prices are set to gross option is set, then the price is initially figured to nett before being added.

* Change :  Added colours to invoice labels status.
* Change :  Improved English language API key directions to provide urls to servers.
* Change :  Improved layout of log file information.
* Change :  Modified exchange rate handling functionality so that if we can't d/l data, we still build a partial file. This prevents various parts of the system re-trying to rebuild this data, we'll just have to accept that for today, we can't convert prices. When the system tries again the next day, more complete data should be available.
* Change :  Added code to die if the call is a heartbeat call from the booking engine then just die, further processing is pointless.


* Fix :  Changed booking engine so that if deposit required is first night then tax is properly included in the price.
* Fix :  Resolved a problem with editing properties in WP
* Fix :  Added a change to how property features are saved in the db as it was affecting property cloning.

* Wordpress :  Added Wordpress functionality that creates a new page with jomres:xx-XX if it doesn't already exist. Negates the need for managers to add pages manually.
* Wordpress :  Added calls to jomres/classes/jomres_database.class.php so that we can monitor WP DB usage.
* Wordpress :  Check if we are in admin area...so that in wp it won`t happen that the framework.php is loaded (because of wp plugins which use actions like 'init' which are available also in admin area - this doesn`t happen on joomla) and does the queries/stuff instead of admin.php.

= Jomres 9.8.14 05/10/2016 = 

* Fix :  Improved how we access some singletons to resolve some people's intermittent performance problems.

= Jomres 9.8.13 03/10/2016 = 

* Feature :  Added functionality that allows us to dynamically add shortcode data to the system, passed directly from minicomponents. 
* Feature :  Repurposed ASAModule report to output information about shortcodes.

* Change :  Removed some redundant help scripts as they're no longer needed.
* Change :  Added a number of changes to get around the Mysql 5.7 Strict NO_ZERO_DATES limitation.
* Change :  Removed Joomla3.x specific versions of library files, which were created back in 2012 in anticipation of more significant version changes given Joomla's past history of significant backward compatability changes. As J3.x is now much more B/C friendly these are no longer required. The downside is that anybody running a very old version of J3.x might have problems running Jomres, but in this day and age it's trivially easy to upgrade Joomla.
* Change :  Added changes relating to how we cleanup sessions.
* Change :  Improved and simplified the media centre class.

* Fix :  Fix intermittent 404 error in wp when submitting a booking.

* Change :  Improved a query in show confirmation regarding how it finds gateways.

* Fix :  Fixed a notice that appears when shortcodes are used in templates and there's no second argument.
* Fix :  Modified how tabs are shown (property config) so that they use random ids instead of language strings. The tab id must be unique otherwise the tab contents will not show.
* Fix :  Fixed issues where wrong table prefix was used in the installer to create sample data.

= Jomres 9.8.10 11/08/2016 =

= Jomres 9.8.9 05/08/2016 =

= Jomres 9.8.8 01/08/2016 = 

* Feature :  Added an option to disable sending emails to managers on errors, expanded notes regarding logging.
* Feature :  Added the ability for Jomres to send logging information to a remote syslog server.
* Feature :  Added functionality to list log files.

* Change :  Turkish language file added to system, many thanks Sarper
* Change :  Spanish, Italian and German language files updated.
* Change :  Tweaked the new user language string sent when a user is created on booking to be function agnostic. Allows us to use the feature for other things.
* Change :  User creation process, typically used when non-registered users create bookings, changed to use email addresses instead of trying to create usernames based on the guest's names. This is because the regex used to determine the username fails to work properly on non-latin alphabets.
* Change :  Previous database audit messages are now saved to logs.
* Change :  Added some friendly notes to property creation.
* Change :  Modified how gateway plugins are validated to allow another plugin to work differently while still maintaining security.
* Change :  Added a new Site Configuration setting that allows a site manager to configure a Minimum Deposit amount. This is required because if commission is charged by you and a third party, then the deposit cannot be less than your commission + third party's commission.
* Change :  Commented a "throw" because spiders are causing error emails to be sent.
* Change :  Removed some redundant data from a call to process payments.
* Change :  Improved installer to test for dirs before attempting to create them.
* Change :  Modified the installer so that failure to create jomres_root.php isn't fatal. It's a silly thing, created to satisfy the Wordpress directory managers, but many servers don't like you to create files in the root for whatever reasons. 
* Change :  Added old-style router file for users who prefer the pre-9.8.0 urls ( Google love ).
* Change :  Modified gateway configuration functionality to allow custom code.
* Change :  Jomres Extras removed from list of our partners as we are integrating their plugins into our own library.

* Fix :  Fixed front and backend Bookings charts.
* Fix :  Fixed a notice when generating log files.
* Fix :  Fixed a bug in property type specific templating.
* Fix :  Improved booking engine, some arrival dates from calendar links were being set incorrectly due to a notice fix in the 9.8.
* Fix :  Resolved a notice in j06005list_gateways_for_invoice.class.php
* Fix :  Modified how guest details are saved from the booking form to work around an issue where if polylang and permalinks were in use, guest details might not be saved to the temp booking data.

== Translations ==

* Jomres includes 31 language files in varying states of translation as we rely on members to feed back their versions of the language files. It includes a [variety of methods for translation](http://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide/53-customising-jomres/editing-labels-languages) allowing you to have different labels for different property types, and even individual properties.

*Note:* If you would like to contribute a language file back to the project please email us at sales@jomres.net, typically an update to a language file will earn you between 1-6 months added to your license, depending on the amount of translation that was required to bring the language file up-to-date.

== Additional Info ==

Upgrades are best performed through the Jomres Updates menu option in the administrator area.

== Post Installation recommendations ==

The Jomres developers are big fans of Bootstrap 3. It's a responsive CSS and Javascript framework that's easy to learn yet offers a great deal of flexibility, flexibility that you will appreciate as you customise the site for your clients or yourselves.

We recommend that the first thing you do is find a Bootstrap 2 or 3 Wordpress template that you like and install that on your site. Next, go to Jomres' Site Configuration area and set "Use Jomres Bootstrap templates in the frontend?" to Yes and set "Bootstrap version" to Bootstrap 2 or 3.

This will ensure that your WP template and the Jomres templates play nicely together.

* Many thanks to [Aladar Barthi](http://www.jomres-extras.com/) for your support of Jomres users, and [Rodrigo Rocco](http://jomres-plugins.com) for your continuing efforts in supporting Jomres users on the forum!
