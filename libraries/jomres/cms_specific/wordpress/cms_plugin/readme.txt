== Description ==

= The multi-property, multi-vendor, multi-language booking portal, be a part of something bigger =

Mature, intelligent, secure and powerful. For 15 years Jomres has been Joomla's premier online booking engine and now it's available for WordPress 😁.

Jomres is a commission-free, responsive, Open Source multi-vendor, multi-language, multi-property online booking plugin for accommodation, rentals and tours used by thousands of businesses worldwide to manage their properties and reservations. You can create an unlimited number of booking websites, accessible to customers on any device, in any language.

Don't confuse it with one of the many WordPress hotel booking themes that are commonly available. Jomres is much, much more than that. Those themes use basic, inflexible booking systems that are very limited. Jomres, instead, is a dedicated online booking plugin that I have been working on solidly for a decade and a half.

From basic features like secure frontend property administration through to powerful developer tools such as it's built-in REST API and  Webhooks functionality, there's something here for everybody. Whether you looking for a booking engine for a single property site, or a complete portal, Jomres is where it's at.

== What's new? ==

= Jomres Syndication Network =

To date Jomres properties have been displayed on other Jomres sites over 64,000,000 times. That's 64 million free adverts that you would not get with any other software.

This free feature is designed to help you get your business off the ground quickly by sharing your properties on other Jomres based sites around the world. [Full description here](https://www.jomres.net/features/jomres-syndication-network), plus [Manual page describing the new functionality](https://www.jomres.net/manual/site-managers-guide-2/388-user-profiles). I don't monitise this feature in any way, there's nothing in it for me except to make Jomres everything you need it to be.

== Demos ==

[See the Single Hotel Demo here](http://wordpress-hotel.jomres.net/)

[See the Portal Demo here - a variety of bookable items, multiple owners](http://wordpress-portal.jomres.net/)

Essential License holders have access to the theme used in the two demos above and special "QuickStart" zip files that enable you to deploy a full installation of WordPress with everything already set up to exactly match either the Single Hotel Demo or the Portal Demos. You can be up-and-running, with a fully-featured booking website that looks terrific, within minutes.


== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New

2. Search for "Jomres"

3. Click Install and activate the plugin. Note, Jomres Core is actually downloaded during activation. As Jomres is pretty big, this can take a minute or more on a slow connection. Please be patient, it's worth the wait.

= Post Installation recommendations =

The Jomres developers are big fans of Bootstrap 3. It's a responsive CSS and Javascript framework that's easy to learn yet offers a great deal of flexibility, flexibility that you will appreciate as you customise the site for your clients or yourselves.

I recommend that the first thing you do is find a Bootstrap 2 or 3 Wordpress theme that you like and install that on your site. Next, go to Jomres' Site Configuration area and set "Use Jomres Bootstrap templates in the frontend?" to Yes and set "Bootstrap version" to Bootstrap 2 or 3.

If you don't have a Bootstrap 3 theme, [you can download our Leohtian theme](https://www.jomres.net/download/free-downloads/download/5-miscelleneous-downloads/11-leohtian-for-wordpress) which is the theme used on the demos.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Jomres free? =

Yes. Jomres follows the [Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_core) business model for Open Source projects. The Jomres Core itself is free to download and install. To help pay the bills some features of the system are delivered as plugins in the Jomres Plugin Manager, to download those you will need a license key saved in your Jomres installation's Site Configuration page.

= Is there a manual? =

Yup, the [manual](https://www.jomres.net/manual/) is available to all users. It's very well documented, and there are video tutorials if you prefer to learn that way.


= Where can I get support? =

If you've got a download and support license you can raise a [ticket](http://tickets.jomres.net), and you can also join the [Community Forum](https://www.jomres.net/forum) and ask your questions there.
