This is because plugins regularly need to be updated to work with current versions of the system, so often your older plugins will not work on a newer version of the system.

You can also have multiple tariffs for the same room type, for example you can have one tariff for Bed&Breakfast and another for Bed, Breakfast & Evening meal.

It allows you to create simple, limited resources that can be booked out, that are not rooms in a property. Whilst the plugin is designed to allow bookings of tours primarily, they can be used for many things, not just tours. They can be used, for example, by a ski lodge that wants to rent out skis and gear. As this equipment will have limited availability, you can use the Jintour plugin to allow guests to reserve and pay for this gear at booking time.');

Log into the frontend and go to the hotel you've created. Next, click on Settings > Tour/Activity management.

The tour profile/generation process is the same as used in the frontend, however any tours generated here are seen in the frontend. One typical scenario where this may be used is if the site administrator is organising events around the country, and they want to sell hotel bookings. They would create the participating hotels in the frontend as normal, setting room prices etc, then the 'tours' in this case would actually be the attendance fee for the event itself.");
