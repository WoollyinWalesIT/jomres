You will also be able to create room features, and assign these features to those rooms. Additionally, you will be able to upload images for individual rooms using the Media Centre.

This mode allows you to set room prices for the next 10 years. <br/>If you are using the Advanced or Micromanage tariff editing modes, then you are able to set room prices for every day for years to come. You can also have multiple tariffs for the same room type, for example you can have one tariff for Bed&Breakfast and another for Bed, Breakfast & Evening meal. Unless you have a specific need, we recommend that you use Micromanage all the time, Advanced will work in the same way but you need to be careful to ensure that your different tariff's start and end dates are consecutive.");
