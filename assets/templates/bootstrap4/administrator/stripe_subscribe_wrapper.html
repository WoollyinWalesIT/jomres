	<p class="small"><a href="https://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php" target="_blank">Ioncube loaders</a> required for trials/subscriptions. If in doubt, please contact your web hosts.</p>
	
	<p class="small">To prevent abuse, we ask all free trial recipients to give valid credit card details to <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe.</a> We do NOT store these details. If you decide to keep using Jomres after your 30-day free trial, Stripe will transfer you to a monthly subscription which you can cancel at any time. Alternatively, cancel at any time during your 30-day trial and you will not be charged anything at all. You can cancel the trial either through logging into Stripe, or logging into your account on Jomres.net and viewing your <a href="https://license-server.jomres.net/index.php?cmd=invoices/index" target="_blank">invoice.</a></p>
	
	<p class="small">If you do not cancel the trial then we will assume that you intend to continue using Jomres and that your subscription is approved.</p>
